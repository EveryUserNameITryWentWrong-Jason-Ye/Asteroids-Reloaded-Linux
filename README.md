Asteroids Reloaded

Credits to:

-Mr.Simon who teaches AP Computer Science(Java) in Lowell High School and originally assigned an assignment* for us students to remake the old Atari Asteroids Game, now it turned into this :D

-Processing.org Exmaple Moving On Curves: https://processing.org/examples/movingoncurves.html (Integrated for Space Ship Movement)

-Support, help, and encouragements from friends and--Mr.Simon--to get everything before v1.01 finished! (And a weird glitch that prevented it from being posted on Github) 

-My still functional slab-together computer(And the one at the school's computer lab, those are nice even if they are homemade...)

-A burning heart!

*This assignment was selected as a "Nifty CS Assignment" in 2008 by Nick Parlante @ Stanford*
