-My still functional slab-together computer(And the one at the school's computer lab, those are nice even if they are homemade...)

-A burning heart!

Known Bugs:

-Gold Ring animation sometimes does not show upon collecting a Space Buck.
 Chance of Occurrence: Not uncommon, 30% - 40% of the time.
 Theory of Existence: Perhaps the system sometimes skips over that one frame for the animation in the haze of all the loops.
 
-Respawn Message does not show up, in the case of this happening, just press 'H' like you would normally do to restart.
 Chance of Occurrence: Very Rare, about 3% - 5% of the time.
 Theory of Existence: Maybe the system skips over that one frame too... 


Cautions: 

-The game runs best with 900x900 resolution (which is the default setting), but if it does not fit to your screen, you can resize it to fit simply by dragging the edges of the application screen like you would resize a webpage. But the difficulty increases as the screen size decreases and lag-ness increases screen size increases, so… pick your pick and mix it up!

-Just be careful when you pick up the last Space Buck before clearing a Stage, especially if it is near where Asteroids spawn…
